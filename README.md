# DeadSimpleNotes

The following project was made with simplicity in mind, as a personal note-taking application/website. The major dependencies of this app are Firebase to handle web hosting and easy deployments and Electron for the purpose of allowing a parallel development process between web and desktop versions. Notes are stored using a Firebase Realtime Database to allow for reliably simple data management.


## Getting Started

This project, while public, has not been cleansed of the existing Firebase credentials/config, so for most cases, it may be in a given user's best interest to create a new Firebase app from scratch to avoid conflict if the user so wishes to use said hosting service. 

The following has been tested on MacOS only, but should run to a varying degree on Windows due to the cross platform support that exists in Electron. 

### Installing

WIP

Example here

```
